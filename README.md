üö¶ Project Stages
Phase 1: Deployment to Docker Container
Containerize the application using Docker: We containerize the application to ensure consistency and portability across environments.

Build and Push Docker Images: We build the application image and push it to a container registry.

Run the Application in a Docker Container: Finally, we run the application inside a Docker container to ensure it's working properly.

Phase 2: Deployment to EKS Cluster with Monitoring
Deploy to Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): The application is deployed to a managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS.

Set up Prometheus and Grafana: We use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization of our application and infrastructure.

Security Scanning with Trivy: Trivy is used for vulnerability scanning on both the file system and Docker images.

Implement Security Best Practices: OWASP guidelines and best practices are followed throughout the deployment process.
